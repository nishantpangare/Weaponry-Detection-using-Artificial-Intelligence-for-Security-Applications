"Harnessing AI to Safeguard Lives: Weaponry-Detection-using-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Security-Applications".

âœ¨ Passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address security concerns and ensure public safety. Excited to share our recent project on automatic gun and weapon detection using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence techniques.

ðŸŽ¯ Our team successfully implemented a robust solution by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest algorithms. We meticulously trained and fine-tuned these models to classify images with remarkable accuracy. With CNN achieving an impressive 96% accuracy, SVM delivering 77%, and Random Forest reaching 88.6%, we have showcased the potential of these algorithms in identifying potential threats in real-time scenarios.
